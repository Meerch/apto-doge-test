        question: 'What is APTOS?',
        answer: 'Aptos is a new Layer 1 blockchain that is faster, more secure, and more scalable than other L1 blockchains that are live today. It was built by former Meta (Libra) engineers, who also developed the Move language for this blockchain. Aptos launched their mainnet some days ago, and made an airdrop of native $APT token for the claim of their free NFT, which has become a game changer for some crypto nerds. For everyone else, this is just another fucking story.'

    {
        question: 'What is FOMO?',
        answer: 'Short form for ‘fear of missing out’. The feeling when you see a huge green dildo on a chart and you don’t own that coin, or you spent a year in ct and never heard about APTOS, so you sell other shit NFTs on SOL to buy into APTOS NFTs. As crypto trading is still very much driven by emotions rather than valuation, FOMO is a huge factor to consider when swing trading in crypto.'

    {
        question: 'Why pooing Doge?',
        answer: 'Looks like it is the best metaphor for your 24/7 ct scrolling and APT airdrop missing at the same time.'
    },
    {
        question: 'Any plans, roadmap?',
        answer: 'Make fun on Aptos, then, be the first who makes shit on $SUI. However, you never know when you’ll want to take the next shit, so we’ll improvise.'

    {
        question: 'What is the best trading strategy?',
